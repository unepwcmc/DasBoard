# DasBoard
A Dashboard to allow drafting objectives for projects, then evaluating them based on visualisations of metrics.

# Testing
Tests are keeping it simple. Written in MiniTest, using Mocha for mocking etc. Our TDD approach is something along the lines of:

1. Write an integration test for new feature, use no mocks or stubs. Have it fail
2. Write a controller test, mocking and stubbing wherever appropriate, particularly new unit methods. Make this pass.
3. Write unit test for new methods introduced in controller tests.
4. Your integration test should now be passing.
